## Final thoughts about your delivery inspection

Please don't be "that guy" that blocks Tesla deliveries and staff for hours while going over your new car with a microscope!
You can report all of the above after you get home, at your leisure: you have a day/100 miles. It’s not like you won’t
accept the car because of some minor issue that can be fixed by a mobile service tech later (but won’t be fixed at
pickup).  Critical things to check on site are VIN, color, wheels, etc. and critical safety, like being able to
lock/unlock the car and put it in park.  Visit and check the local super charger while you are there, too.

## What next?

Should anything escape factory QC, service center QC, and the above checklist here are some options to be aware of:
- If the quality of the car is inadequate you can **refuse delivery**. Following that you should be assigned a new VIN.
- After leaving the lot you have 72 hours/100 miles to **report delivery issues to be fixed free of charge**. The 72 hours
refers to items subject to "wear and tear," such as paint defects, scratches, etc. Any item that would normally be covered
under warranty is still covered under warranty, but things like blemishes, scratches, dings, scuffs, aren't covered by any
other car company. However check [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaModelY/comments/hh8mgv/rattling_in_back_seats_reported_within_7_days/)
about a problem reported within the first 7 days of ownership and being asked to accept a cost estimate.

## Ownership beyond the first 1,000 miles

Making it past the above milestones doesn't mean that SC visits or Mobile Service appointments are a thing of the past. Remaining problems caused by
QC issues may be covered by [Tesla's New Vehicle Warranty](https://www.tesla.com/support/vehicle-warranty), which for Long Range and Performance
MYs is 8 years or 120,000 miles.
